Globally, we are facing an unprecedented biodiversity crisis, with megadiverse countries becoming critical focal points for conservation efforts. South Africa, unique in Africa for containing three biodiversity hotspots, is a region of remarkable species diversity, including numerous species at risk of extinction that urgently require protection. However, the conservation process is hindered by prolonged risk assessment procedures and a lack of necessary data, potentially leading to species becoming extinct while awaiting evaluation.
In this study, we implemented a deep neural network model to predict the conservation status of 116 unassessed plant species by integrating climatic and geographic data. Our analysis encompassed 1,072 plant species and 96,963 occurrence points. Of these, 956 species were used to train the model, and 116 species were reserved for prediction. The model demonstrated high accuracy, achieving up to 83.6% accuracy in binary classification and 56.8% in detailed classification.
At the binary classification level, our best-performing model predicts that 25 species (32%) of the Data Deficient (DD) and 3 species (8%) of the Not Evaluated (NE) categories are likely threatened. This suggests that approximately 24.1% of unassessed species might be facing extinction risks. Interestingly, all unassessed species predicted to be threatened are outside protected areas, revealing the effectiveness of the South Africaâ€™s network of protected areas in conservation. Considering the limitation in assessing only species with available data, there remains a possibility of a higher proportion of unassessed species being imperilled.
